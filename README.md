# Weather or Not?

We created this page to allow users to input a city and receive a list of events going on in their area. Next to the list of events, the user will also be presented with the weather forecast corresponding with the dates of the events listed in order to decide if the event is attendable or not. 

## Technologies used
We used the openweathermap API in order to retrieve a 5 day forecast of a given city. We then used the Ticketmaster API to display events in the city given for the next week. In order to style the page, we used the CSS framework called Bulma. Other than that, the only languages we used were HTML and JavaScript.
